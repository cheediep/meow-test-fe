## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on port 3000. If you haven't already, head over to the [backend repo](https://github.com/cheediep/meow-test-be) and set it up as well.

## Testing

The test page can be found at `http://localhost:3000/welcome/{USER_ID}`. Valid test user IDs can be found in [the data file](https://github.com/cheediep/meow-test-be/blob/main/data.ts) in the backend repo.
